# Calendar Example

## Instructions

- Clone repo
- bower install
- npm install
- If is necessary npm run build, to make scripts
- Open index.html in browser

## Not solved

- The last invalid days of last month, doesn't parse correctly
- I'm using the Test API Key, because the production API Key doesn't work with a simple HTML file
